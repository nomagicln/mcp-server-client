# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The `mcpsc` (MCP Server Client) is a Node.js + TypeScript command-line tool that serves as an MCP protocol gateway middleware. It provides unified connection, management, and exposure capabilities for heterogeneous environment resources (hosts, API endpoints). The tool can function both as an MCP Server (providing MCP protocol interfaces for LLM Agent calls) and as an MCP Client (connecting to other MCP services for cascading, aggregation, and proxy capabilities).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: CLI Command System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive CLI interface with intuitive commands, so that I can easily manage MCP resources and services without complex configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `mcpsc help <cmd>` OR `mcpsc <cmd> --help` THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive help documentation including parameter descriptions, examples, and default values
2. WHEN I run `mcpsc init` THEN the system SHALL generate a default configuration file with optional `--force` and `--output <path>` parameters
3. WHEN I run `mcpsc config set <key> <value>` THEN the system SHALL modify the configuration at runtime and persist the changes
4. WHEN I run `mcpsc validate` THEN the system SHALL verify configuration file structure and semantic validity with optional `--config <path>` parameter
5. WHEN I use any CLI command THEN the system SHALL follow Unix philosophy with simple, memorable naming conventions

### Requirement 2: Resource Management System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage various types of environment resources (SSH hosts, HTTP APIs) through a unified interface, so that I can centrally control access to heterogeneous systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add a local resource THEN the system SHALL support multiple local path scanning with `mcpsc resource add local --path` command
2. WHEN I start the system THEN the system SHALL support specifying resource locations via `--resource-path` or `--resource-config` parameters to load from non-default locations
3. WHEN I add a remote resource THEN the system SHALL support multiple remote sources with authentication (Basic Auth, API Key, Bearer Token)
4. WHEN I configure a resource THEN the system SHALL support resource naming, grouping, and enable/disable functionality
5. WHEN I add resources via CLI THEN the system SHALL dynamically reflect resource type schemas (auto-prompt for `--user`, `--host`, `--key` for SSH resources)
6. WHEN I manage resources THEN the system SHALL support both SSH hosts (IP/domain, port, user, key) and HTTP API endpoints (URL, auth, methods, headers)

### Requirement 3: Connection Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust connection capabilities for different protocols, so that I can reliably connect to various remote systems with proper security and testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I connect via SSH THEN the system SHALL use ssh2 library supporting keys, passwords, jump hosts, and port forwarding
2. WHEN I connect via SSH THEN the system SHALL read `~/.ssh/config` and support independent testing with `mcpsc connect ssh <resource> [--dry-run]`
3. WHEN I connect via HTTP THEN the system SHALL use undici or native http2 modules supporting GET/POST/PUT/DELETE methods
4. WHEN I connect via HTTP THEN the system SHALL support headers, body, query parameters and independent testing with `mcpsc connect http <url> --method GET`
5. WHEN I configure TLS THEN the system SHALL support custom TLS Cipher Suites, self-signed certificates, and CA trust chain configuration

### Requirement 4: MCP Server Capabilities

**User Story:** As an integration developer, I want the tool to function as a complete MCP server with multiple transport protocols, so that I can integrate with various LLM agents and development environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start the server THEN the system SHALL support stdio transport protocol for local process calls
2. WHEN I start the server THEN the system SHALL support SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport for Web/IDE integration
3. WHEN I start the server THEN the system SHALL support Streamable HTTP transport for LLM Agent integration
4. WHEN I enable HTTPS THEN the system SHALL support `--cert` and `--key` parameters with custom TLS configuration
5. WHEN I configure CORS THEN the system SHALL support configurable allowed origins with development mode defaults
6. WHEN I start the server THEN the system SHALL use command `mcpsc server start --transport <type> [--host] [--port] [--tls-*] [--cors-*]`

### Requirement 5: MCP Client Capabilities

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the tool to connect to other MCP services as a client, so that I can create cascaded and aggregated MCP service architectures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I connect as client THEN the system SHALL support connections to remote mcpsc instances and standard MCP services
2. WHEN I negotiate protocols THEN the system SHALL support transport protocol negotiation (prioritizing SSE/Streamable HTTP over stdio)
3. WHEN I connect to remote services THEN the system SHALL use command `mcpsc client connect <url> --transport streamable-http`

### Requirement 6: Configuration System

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want flexible configuration management with multiple sources and formats, so that I can deploy the tool in various environments with appropriate settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL follow priority: default config < config file < environment variables < CLI parameters
2. WHEN I provide configuration THEN the system SHALL support JSON (with comments), YAML, JavaScript (CommonJS), and TypeScript formats
3. WHEN I use environment variables THEN the system SHALL recognize `MCPSC_` prefix (e.g., `MCPSC_SERVER_PORT=3000`)
4. WHEN I store sensitive information THEN the system SHALL support `${ENV_VAR}` injection and optional encryption fields
5. WHEN I manage configuration THEN the system SHALL validate structure and semantics before application

### Requirement 7: Security Requirements

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want comprehensive security controls for all connections and data handling, so that I can ensure secure communication and protect sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I establish external connections THEN the system SHALL support authentication and encryption for all SSH/HTTP connections
2. WHEN I configure TLS THEN the system SHALL support custom security policies (Cipher Suites, protocol versions)
3. WHEN I define resources THEN the system SHALL support resource-level security configuration (e.g., "TLS 1.3 only")
4. WHEN I view logs THEN the system SHALL mask sensitive fields by default with optional `--show-secrets` flag
5. WHEN I handle credentials THEN the system SHALL provide secure storage and transmission mechanisms

### Requirement 8: Observability and Monitoring
