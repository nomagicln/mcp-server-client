## Notes on Current Implementation Status

**Completed Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Project setup with TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Jest
- ✅ Core interfaces and type definitions
- ✅ Comprehensive configuration management system with Zod validation
- ✅ CLI framework with oclif and working init/validate commands
- ✅ Structured logging with pino and correlation IDs
- ✅ Metrics collection infrastructure
- ✅ Resource management core with ResourceRegistry and ResourceManager
- ✅ Local resource loader with file watching and multi-format support

**Partially Implemented:**
- 🔄 CLI config set command (stub exists, needs full implementation)
- 🔄 Remote resource loader (placeholder exists, needs implementation)
- 🔄 MCP services (stubs exist, need full implementation)
- 🔄 Transport layers (stubs exist, need implementation)
- 🔄 Connectors (stubs exist, need implementation)

**Key Implementation Gaps:**
- Remote resource loading with HTTP client and authentication
- MCP protocol implementation (server, client, session management)
- Transport layer implementations (stdio, SSE, HTTP)
- SSH and HTTP connector implementations
- Security and authentication system
- Complete CLI command suite for resource and server management

The foundation is solid with comprehensive configuration management, logging, and resource management infrastructure. The next priority should be implementing the remote resource loader, followed by the MCP protocol components and transport layers.
